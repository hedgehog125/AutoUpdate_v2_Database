## Launching a new version

To launch a new version first open database/Versions.txt...

add the new version to the list.

E.g...

Add "2.2" into the array.

Then make sure your database is set to your clone.

E.g:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hedgehog125/Auto-Update-Database/master/

Next, use the JSON generator located in [AutoUpdate_v2 repo]/Update Launcher.py.


Hope this helps! :D
